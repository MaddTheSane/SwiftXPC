# SwiftXPC

This is a Swift binding of the OS X XPC module. It makes it possible to call 95% of the public XPC API
from pure Swift.

To use this framework, you must be running Xcode 7.1. Clone this repository, add the Xcode project
to your application, and copy `SwiftXPC.framework` into your appâ€™s Frameworks folder.
