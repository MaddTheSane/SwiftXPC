// XPCSharedMemoryRegion allocates a region of memory not less than the given length
// at time of creation. You can call the readMemory() method to get back a copy
// of the memory region. (Each time you call this method, you get a different
// address; however, the memory regions are all shared and changes to one will
// update the others.) Keep the SharedMemoryPointer instance returned in a
// variable for as long as you need to access it. When the pointer instance
// is deallocated, its backing memory will be unmapped. Note, however, that the
// data still exists until the last reference to it is destroyed; then and only
// then will it be deallocated.
